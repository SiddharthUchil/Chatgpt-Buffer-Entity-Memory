# Chatgpt_Buffer_Entity_Memory
Memory involves keeping a concept of state around throughout a user’s interactions with an language model. A user’s interactions with a language model are captured in the concept of ChatMessages, so this boils down to ingesting, capturing, transforming and extracting knowledge from a sequence of chat messages.

### CoversationalBufferMemory allows you to store messages and then extract those messages in a variable.
### Entity Memory lets you extract information on entities using LLMs and builds up the knowledge about the entity over time.
